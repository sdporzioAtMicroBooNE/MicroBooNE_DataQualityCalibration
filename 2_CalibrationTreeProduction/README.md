Launch campaign on the grid to generate xyzCorrection trees and dqm_hist tree. The first will be used by Varuna's module (see steps 3,4,5 of this repository). The dqm_hist tree are produced at the end of reco1 and reco2 steps (the actual reco1 and reco2 files are thrown away in this setup), these files (or better, the samweb definition for these files) can then be handed to the experts in charge of DQM who should be able to produce a good run list from that.
